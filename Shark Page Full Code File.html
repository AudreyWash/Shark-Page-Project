<h2 style ="color:White;font-size:29px;font-family:Times">What Are Sharks?</h2>

<!-- FIRST PARAGRAPH -->
<p style ="color:Black;font-family:Times;font-size:19px"><b><i> Sharks are a type of long-bodied marine fish with a cartilaginous skeleton (skeleton made entirely of cartilage), a large dorsal fin, and toothlike scales (also called placoid). Most sharks are predatory, although the largest kinds feed on plankton. The common myth is that sharks attack humans whenever humans are within the vicinity of them, but of all 470 species, only somewhere around a dozen are dangerous to humans, and even the ones that are do not prefer to eat them.</b></i></p>

<h3 style ="color:White;font-family:Times;font-size:29px"> Where Are Sharks Found?</h3>

<!-- MY SECOND PARAGRAPH -->
 <p style ="color:Black;font-family:Times;font-size:19px"><b><i>Sharks live in all five of the Earth's oceans: the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and Southern. Although they are commonly found in oceans, sharks can also be found in freshwater/saltwater lakes and some rivers too. Oftentimes, sharks swim in the Epipelagic zone (the topmost layer of the ocean) which is where human beings swim as well, but sharks rarely bother them.</b></i></p>

<!-- HEADER 4 -->
<h4 style ="color:White;font-family:Times;font-size:29px"> What Do Sharks Eat?</h4>

<!-- MY THIRD PARAGRAPH -->
<p style ="color:Black;font-family:Times;font-size:19px"><b><i>Sharks eat a wide variety of marine life ranging from smaller organisms like snails, sea urchins, crabs, and fish to larger organisms like stingrays, seals, birds, and even other sharks. As apex predators, sharks play an important role in the oceanic ecosystem by maintaining the diversity of the species below them and keeping balance with competitors. Just to give an example of how important these creatures are, a decrease in the shark population could result in the overgrowth of algae or the extinction of smaller animals like scallops who rely on sharks to eat their predators. </b></i></p>

<!-- THE FOURTH PARAGRAPH  -->
<p style ="color:Black;font-family:Times;font-size:19px"><b><i>According to IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) analysts, among all 470 species of sharks, 2.4 percent are critically endangered, 3.2 percent are endangered, 10.3 percent are vulnerable, and 14.4 percent are near threatened by commercial shark finning (usually for medicine or shark fin soup), overfishing, fisheries bycatch, and habitat loss.</b></i></p>
